Design Decisions & Edge Cases

How do you handle files that no longer exist on disk?
Ans: f a file path no longer exists, the entry is automatically removed from the history list.

How do you prevent duplicate entries in history?
Ans: Each file path is stored as a UNIQUE column in SQLite, preventing duplicate inserts.

How do you optimize loading for large numbers of files?
Ans: SQLite is used for scalable persistence and files are displayed using ListView.builder for lazy rendering.

How do you handle file type detection?
Ans: File type is determined based on the file extension and source (PDF generated by the scanner).

What happens if storage operations fail?
Ans: All storage and scanner operations are wrapped in try-catch blocks, and user feedback is provided when failures occur.
